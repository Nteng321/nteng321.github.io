    <h3 id='g1'> Fav#1 - Game </h3>
        <br>
        <p> <b> Cyberpunk 2077 </b> <br>
		My favorite game is "Cyberpunk 2077". it's my favorite because the world aspect and story really interest me since it takes place in a dystopian future where everything is corrupted by corporations. 
		The game play being of that like skyrim and taking a more roleplay type of game. It really makes me feel like I'm really in that world, also the weapons and cybernetics that can be installed are really fun to build and play around with.

    <h3 id='s1'> Fav#2 - Tv Show </h3>
        <br>
        <pre> <b> HOUSE MD </b> <br>
		<p><b>House md is about a doctor who can diagnose the hardest cases with his team. 
		I like House's attitude and how he can be really rude to the patient and to everyone around him 
		but he is usually 
		right about the diagnosis.

    <h3 id='g2'> Fav#3 - Game </h3>
        <br>
        <pre> <b> Risk of Rain 2 </b> <br>
		<p><b>Risk of rain 2 is a game about surviving and progressing stages until you get

			<h3 id='s2'> Fav#4 - Movie </h3>
        <br>
        <pre> <b> Dragon ball Super: Super heroes</b> <br>
		<p><b>Dragon ball super: Super heroes follows the DB super story line, but in this movie it mostly follows piccolo trying to save gohans daughter from the newly risen Red Ribbon Army which specializes on androids 
		and they have 2 new androids who are powerful so piccolo with the help of gohan infultrate their facility and try to take Gohan's daugter back but are ultimately hindered by the 2 new androids who they have to fight. 
		Gohan and Piccolo win the fight with piccolo gaining a new power up. Gohan's daughter gets saved but then a new android is released and is stronger than everyone. Gohan powers up to stop them and piccolo distracts 
		the new android. Gohan gains a new power up and defeats the android and wins. What I like about this movie is that it has 2 of my favorite characters as the main stars.
